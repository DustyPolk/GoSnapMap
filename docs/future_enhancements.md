# Future Enhancements: Photo Location Mapper

This document lists potential future enhancements and features for the Photo Location Mapper application, building upon the initial MVP.

## 1. User Accounts and Management

-   **User Registration & Login:** Allow users to create accounts to save their photo uploads and map history.
-   **Password Reset:** Implement a secure password reset functionality.
-   **User Profiles:** Basic user profiles where users can manage their account details.

## 2. Enhanced Photo Management

-   **Photo Galleries:** Allow users to view all their uploaded photos in a gallery format.
-   **Persistent Storage:** Store uploaded images and their extracted metadata in a database and cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
-   **Edit Photo Details:** Allow users to add/edit captions, dates, or manually adjust locations if EXIF data is incorrect or missing.
-   **Delete Photos:** Allow users to delete their uploaded photos.
-   **Batch Uploads:** Support uploading multiple images at once.

## 3. Advanced Mapping Features

-   **Multiple Markers:** Display multiple photo locations on a single map (e.g., for a gallery or a trip).
-   **Clustering:** Group nearby markers together at higher zoom levels for better readability.
-   **Custom Map Styles:** Allow users to choose different map styles (e.g., satellite, terrain, dark mode).
-   **Drawing on Map:** Allow users to manually pinpoint a location if EXIF data is unavailable.
-   **Heatmaps:** Visualize the density of photo locations.
-   **Route Plotting:** If multiple photos from a trip are uploaded, plot a route connecting them.

## 4. Social and Sharing Features

-   **Shareable Links:** Generate unique links for users to share their mapped photos or galleries.
-   **Embeddable Maps:** Provide code snippets to embed maps on other websites.
-   **(Optional) Social Login:** Allow login via Google, Facebook, etc.

## 5. Improved EXIF and Geolocation Handling

-   **Support More EXIF Tags:** Extract and display other relevant EXIF data (camera model, date taken, etc.).
-   **Manual Geotagging:** Allow users to add location data to photos that don't have it.
-   **Reverse Geocoding:** Convert latitude/longitude to a human-readable address or place name and display it.
-   **Timezone Handling:** Properly handle and display dates and times based on photo location or user preference.

## 6. Performance and Scalability

-   **Image Optimization:** Optimize images on upload (e.g., compression, resizing for thumbnails) to improve loading times and reduce storage costs.
-   **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., EXIF data, map tiles).
-   **Background Processing:** For tasks like batch uploads or intensive image processing, use background workers (e.g., Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ).

## 7. UI/UX Improvements

-   **Advanced Search and Filtering:** Allow users to search or filter photos by date, location, tags, etc.
-   **Improved Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure a seamless experience on mobile devices.
-   **Accessibility (a11y):** Adhere to web accessibility standards.
-   **Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n):** Support multiple languages.

## 8. Backend and Technical Enhancements

-   **More Robust API:** Add more API endpoints for new features, versioning.
-   **Enhanced Security:** Implement more advanced security measures (e.g., rate limiting, input sanitization, security headers).
-   **Automated Testing:** Expand test coverage (unit, integration, end-to-end tests).
-   **Analytics:** Integrate analytics to understand user behavior and application usage.

These are just ideas, and the priority of each would depend on user feedback and project goals after the MVP is launched.
