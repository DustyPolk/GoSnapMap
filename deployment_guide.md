# Deployment Guide: Photo Location Mapper

This document provides a general guide and considerations for deploying the Photo Location Mapper application, which consists of a Python (Flask/FastAPI) backend and a React frontend.

## 1. Deployment Strategy Overview

Typically, the frontend and backend are deployed separately:

-   **Frontend (React):** Deployed as a static site to a CDN or a static hosting provider.
-   **Backend (Python):** Deployed as a web service/API on a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), container orchestration platform, or a Virtual Private Server (VPS).

## 2. Frontend Deployment (React App)

1.  **Build the React App:**
    Create a production build of your React application.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    # yarn build
    ```
    This will generate a `build` (or `dist`) folder containing optimized static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

2.  **Choose a Hosting Provider:**
    -   **Netlify:** Excellent for static sites, CI/CD integration, custom domains, HTTPS.
    -   **Vercel:** Similar to Netlify, particularly good for Next.js (though works well for any React app), CI/CD, custom domains.
    -   **GitHub Pages:** Free hosting for public repositories, good for simple projects.
    -   **AWS S3 & CloudFront:** Scalable and robust, but more complex to set up. S3 for hosting static files, CloudFront as a CDN.
    -   **Firebase Hosting:** Easy to use, integrates well with other Firebase services.

3.  **Deployment Steps (General Example with Netlify/Vercel):
    -   Sign up for the service.
    -   Connect your Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
    -   Configure build settings (e.g., build command: `npm run build`, publish directory: `build`).
    -   Set environment variables (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_URL` pointing to your deployed backend's URL).
    -   The service will typically auto-deploy on pushes to the main branch.

## 3. Backend Deployment (Python API)

1.  **Prepare for Production:**
    -   **WSGI Server:** Use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI for Flask (FastAPI often uses Uvicorn with Gunicorn as a process manager).
    -   **Environment Variables:** Manage sensitive information (API keys, database URLs, secret keys) using environment variables, not hardcoded values.
    -   **Dependencies:** Ensure `requirements.txt` is accurate and includes all necessary packages with specific versions if possible.
    -   **CORS Configuration:** Ensure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is correctly configured for your production frontend domain.

2.  **Choose a Hosting Provider/Platform:**
    -   **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):**
        -   **Heroku:** Easy to deploy Python applications, managed environment.
        -   **Google App Engine:** Scalable platform for web applications.
        -   **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** Orchestrates various AWS services to host your application.
        -   **Render:** Modern PaaS, offers free tiers for web services and databases.
        -   **PythonAnywhere:** Specifically for Python web apps, simpler for beginners.
    -   **Containers (Docker):**
        -   Create a `Dockerfile` for your Python application.
        -   Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry).
        -   Deploy the container to services like:
            -   **AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)**
            -   **AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**
            -   **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**
            -   **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
            -   **DigitalOcean App Platform (supports Docker)**
    -   **Virtual Private Server (VPS):**
        -   **AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, DigitalOcean Droplets, Linode.**
        -   Requires manual setup of the server environment, web server (Nginx/Apache), WSGI server, process manager (systemd/supervisor), firewall, etc.
        -   More control but more maintenance.

3.  **Deployment Steps (General Example with PaaS like Heroku/Render):
    -   Sign up and install the platform's CLI (e.g., Heroku CLI).
    -   Create a `Procfile` (e.g., `web: gunicorn app:app` for Flask).
    -   Initialize a Git repository if not already done.
    -   Commit your code.
    -   Create an app on the platform.
    -   Set environment variables (e.g., `FLASK_ENV=production`, any API keys).
    -   Push your code to the platform's remote (e.g., `git push heroku main`).
    -   The platform builds and deploys your application.

## 4. Domain Names and HTTPS

-   **Custom Domain:** Configure custom domain names for both frontend and backend if desired.
-   **HTTPS:** Essential for security. Most modern hosting platforms provide free SSL/TLS certificates (e.g., via Let's Encrypt) and manage them for you.

## 5. Database Deployment (If Applicable)

-   If using a database, PaaS providers often offer managed database services (e.g., Heroku Postgres, AWS RDS).
-   Configure your backend application with the production database URL via environment variables.

## 6. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

-   Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Netlify/Vercel's built-in CI/CD).
-   Automate testing, building, and deploying your application whenever changes are pushed to your repository.

## 7. Logging and Monitoring

-   Ensure your backend application has proper logging.
-   Utilize monitoring tools provided by your hosting platform or integrate third-party services to track application performance and errors.

This guide covers the main aspects of deploying a full-stack application. The specific steps will vary based on the chosen hosting providers and tools.
